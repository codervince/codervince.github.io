These are some of the things I am doing at the moment (:point_down:).

*  Racedata app: 
   Cleaning data - the process never ends
   Simplifying the app to move from SQL Server to Postgres
   NodeJS API to new database - CRUD including filtered display of historical data
*  Preparing for Georgia Tech OMSCS
   Reviewing Python
   R
* Is Finance worth it?
  C++
  Quantlib


How does this look?
